Iâ€™m a big fan of doing one thing and doing it well. With that, I give you the ChangeRaidTime mod. It allows you to change the raid time of maps individually or override them all to one single time.

Copy the `ChangeRaidTime` directory in your `./user/mods/` directory. Open the `ChangeRaidTime/config/config.json` file to adjust raid time options.

Enjoy.
