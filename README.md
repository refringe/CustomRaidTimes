Iâ€™m a big fan of doing one thing and doing it well. With that, I give you the ChangeRaidTime mod. It allows you to change the raid time of maps individually or override them all to one single time.

Uncompress the contents of the download into the `./user/mods/` directory.  
Open the `ChangeRaidTime/config/config.json` file to adjust raid time options.

Enjoy.
