This is a mod for Single Player Tarkov.  
https://www.sp-tarkov.com

The scope of this mod is to allow the you to adjust your raid times, and have the game still function "normally".

Features:

 - Adjust global raid times, or raid times for individual maps.
 - Raid times can be random ranges, grouped, and weighted.
 - Extract train schedules automatically adjust to the new raid time.
   - Earliest arrival time (given enough overall time) can be anywhere in between 35% to 80% of the total raid time, making train arrival less predictable and also more usable in extra long raids.
   - The number of seconds the train waits before closing the doors and departing is now randomized; but always between 14 and 7 minutes.
   - Raids can now be as short as 3 minutes and still have an active and functional train extract.
 - Bot spawn waves are adjusted so that they continue to spawn until the end of the raid.
 - Number of active bots is increased.

Many options are configurable.

To install:

1. Uncompress the contents of the download into the `./user/mods/` directory.  
2. Open the `CustomRaidTime/config/config.json5` file to adjust raid time options.
3. Leave a review and let me know what you think.
